5. Select a lobby with the “JOIN” status and click “Join Lobby” or if no available lobbies exist, click “New Lobby” to create one.
6. If making a new lobby, specify a unique lobby name and then click “Create New Lobby” to make your new lobby available and viewable for other clients. Or click “Return to Lobbies” to cancel your new lobby and see the list of available lobbies again.
7. If a new lobby was made or you joined an existing one, the game will not begin until four players have connected to please wait.
8. Once the fourth player has connected, the game will automatically begin.
9. Type the word you see on your screen as quickly as possible and you’ll then wait for the other players to finish typing too.
10. The first player to type the word gains a point for that round and the first to five points wins the game.
11. After winning or losing, you’ll be returned to the lobby view to begin again from step 5.
